        <p>Here's a brief bio of me that includes snippets of my life. </p>

        <div class="heading">Jeju Island, Korea</div>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea up until middle school, but went to high school in Jeju island-a volcanic island at the southern tip of Korea. I spent a lot of time biking and diving in the waters. Seeing the beauties of the waters made me want to study marine science or physics in college.

        <div class="heading">UC Berkeley - Freshmen 2019</div>
        <hr>
        <p> A lot changed my first semester there. I took an introductory cs class taught in Snap!(berkeley's version of scratch) with the nudge of a friend and loved it. Maybe it was the combination of having a friend to do fun projects with along with many dorm friends also taking cs classes.

        <div class="heading">Korean Navy 2020~2022</div>
        <hr>
        <p> When covid struck I came back to Korea and served in the Korean Navy. I was on a battleship as a boatswain's mate, but towards the end of my service I met a friend who introduced me to ML. It was a happy combination of science and engineering. After my service, I did my first ML project in underwater CV where I turned my distorted diving photos into ones that were clean.

        <div class="heading">UC Berkeley - 2022~Spring 2024</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-18"> I got into lots of rabbit holes in this era, mostly in computer vision. It was an exciting time where big ideas were coming out each month.</p>
        <p class="font-size-18">And I started to wonder what it would be like to do these rabbit hole dives full time, away from classes for a while.</p>

        <div class="heading">Seoul, Korea - 2024</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-18"> In the Spring of 2024, I started my gap year to study things full-time.</p>
        <p class="font-size-18"> I discovered that explanability in approaches is a large quality I value and that it's so much fun making programs go fast.</p>
        <p class="font-size-18"> This led me to pursue approaches for making ML more efficient and faster when I go back to Berkeley.</p>
