        <hr>
        <p>I'm a CS student at UC Berkeley who's currently taking a gap away from school to self-learn with my own curriculmn. This blog is to document and organize my learning.

        <div class="heading">Jeju Island, Korea</div>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea up until middle school, but went to high school in Jeju island-a volcanic island at the southern tip of Korea. I spent a lot of time biking and diving in the waters. Seeing the beauties of the waters made me want to study marine science or physics in college.

        <div class="heading">UC Berkeley - Freshmen 2019</div>
        <hr>
        <p> A lot changed my first semester there. I took an introductory cs class taught in Snap!(berkeley's version of scratch) with the nudge of a friend and loved it. Maybe it was the combination of having a friend to do fun projects with along with many dorm friends also taking cs classes.

        <div class="heading">Korean Navy 2020~2022</div>
        <hr>
        <p> When covid struck I came back to Korea and served in the Korean Navy. I was on a battleship as a boatswain's mate, but towards the end of my service I met a friend who introduced me to ML. It was a happy combination of science and engineering. After my service, I did my first ML project in underwater CV where I turned my distorted diving photos into ones that were clean.

        <div class="heading">UC Berkeley - 2022~Spring 2024</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-18"> I spent most of my time reading papers instead of classwork. I wandered through lots of rabbit holes ranging from monocular depth estimation, multi-agent RL, diffusion, hyperbolical NNs, and GNNs. They were mostly methodology papers, but I realized there's a lot of overlooked engineering that's not specified well in these papers.

        <div class="heading">Seoul, Korea - present</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-18"> I'm taking a gap back in seoul studying the engineering behind ML, especially memory-optimization and efficient scaling methods.
